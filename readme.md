It's basically the same as <a href='https://github.com/wuzue/capivara-do-pix'>this repo</a>. The only difference is that this code is in Java and uses some different things like Spring, H2, Spring Data JPA... But it does the same thing. <br>

I didn't make this project to be run out of the box like the original one that's using Docker so, If you wanna try it, go to <a href='https://github.com/wuzue/capivara-do-pix'>this repo</a>. <br>

This code is a just a Java representation of how that project would look like in Java.
